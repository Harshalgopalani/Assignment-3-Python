Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python
Module 4 ‚Äì Functions and Modules
This repository contains the solution for Assignment 3 from Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python. The tasks focus on defining and using functions, along with Python‚Äôs built-in math module for performing various calculations.

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
üìù Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using either a loop or recursion.

Returns the calculated factorial.

Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

‚úÖ Expected Behavior
#Output:
# Enter integer number only: 6
# The factorial of 6 is 720


Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
üìù Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Asks the user for a number as input.

Uses the math module to calculate:

The square root of the number

The natural logarithm (log base e)

‚úÖ Expected Behavior
#Output:
# Enter a number: 15
# Square root of 15.0 is: 3.872983346207417
# Natural logarithm (ln) of 15.0 is: 2.70805020110221
# Sine of 15.0 radians is: 0.6502878401571168

The sine of the number (in radians)

Displays the calculated results.
